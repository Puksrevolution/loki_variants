                    <p class="text__history">
                        Many years ago, when Bor, ruler of Asgard, was battling frost giants,
                        he followed a wounded giant to a powerful sorcerer that was waiting for him.
                        The sorcerer caught him unaware, turning Bor into snow. Bor's son, Odin,
                        found his father as he was blowing away; Bor begged Odin to find a sorcerer to free him,
                        but Odin made no attempt to save his father. Bor cursed Odin saying that he would take in
                        the son of a fallen king and raise it as his own. Not a week later, Odin himself led the
                        Asgardians
                        into battle against the Frost Giants and killed Laufey, who was the King, in personal combat.
                        After slaying Laufey, Odin found a small Asgardian-sized child hidden within the primary
                        stronghold
                        of the Frost Giants. The child was Loki; Laufey having kept him hidden from the Frost Giant
                        people
                        due to his shame over his son's small size. Odin took the child, out of a combination of pity,
                        to appease the memory of his father, and because he was the child of a worthy adversary slain
                        in honorable combat, and raised as his own alongside his biological son Thor.
                        Throughout his childhood and into adolescence, Loki was resentful of the differences between how
                        Thor
                        and himself were treated by the citizens of Asgard. The Asgardians valued great strength,
                        tenacity,
                        and bravery in battle above all things, and Loki was clearly inferior to his brother Thor in
                        those areas.
                        What he lacked in size and strength, however, he made up for in power and skill, particularly as
                        a sorcerer.
                        As Loki grew to adulthood, his natural talent for causing mischief would make itself manifest
                        and earned
                        him a nickname as the "God of Mischief"; his mischievousness eventually became malice as his
                        hunger for
                        power and revenge grew stronger. Several times he tried to use tricks to get rid of Thor, such
                        as telling
                        him to guard a hole in the wall that he himself had made. In time, his reputation grew from
                        being a
                        playful and mischievous trickster to the "God of Evil". Over the centuries, Loki attempted on
                        many
                        occasions to seize the rulership of Asgard and to destroy Thor, even helping the Storm Giant
                        Ghan to
                        escape Thor planning to get a debt from him later, and aided other enemies of Asgard, planning
                        to take over.
                        Odin, who had grown weary of Loki's mischief, magically imprisoned him within a tree until
                        someone would shed
                        a tear for his plight. Loki eventually freed himself by causing a leaf to strike Heimdall, the
                        guardian of
                        Bifrost, in the eye, which made him shed a tear. Loki compiled an extensive criminal record in
                        Asgard, and
                        was frequently exiled. He later met the Sorcerer Eldred, who taught him black magic, repaying
                        Eldred
                        by later giving him to the Fire demon Surtur.

                                Loki, in Norse mythology, a cunning trickster who had the ability to change his shape
                                and sex. Although his father was the giant Fárbauti, he was included among the Aesir
                                (a tribe of gods).
                                Loki was represented as the companion of the great gods Odin and Thor, helping them with
                                his
                                clever plans but sometimes causing embarrassment and difficulty for them and himself. He
                                also
                                appeared as the enemy of the gods, entering their banquet uninvited and demanding their
                                drink.
                                He was the principal cause of the death of the god Balder. Loki was bound to a rock (by
                                the
                                entrails of one or more of his sons, according to some sources) as punishment, thus in
                                many ways
                                resembling the Greek figures Prometheus and Tantalus. Also like Prometheus, Loki is
                                considered a
                                god of fire.
